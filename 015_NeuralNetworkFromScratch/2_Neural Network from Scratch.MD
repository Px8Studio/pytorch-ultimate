### Forward Pass Explained

Let's revisit the forward pass structure:
1.  **Input Data (`X`):** Starts with our training data.
2.  **Layer 1 (`l1`):** Processes the input using weights (`w`) and biases (`b`).
    *   Calculation: `l1 = X * w + b` (simplified representation).
3.  **Activation Function:** Applies a non-linearity. We'll use the Sigmoid function for classification.ghts `w`) process each input differently and add some finishing touches (bias `b`).
    *   Sigmoid Function: `S(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.ers diminish them.
    *   The output `S` depends on the output of layer 1: `S = sigmoid(l1)`.
4.  **Predictions (`y_pred`):** The output of the activation function serves as our predictions. Gateway (Activation Function):** Not everything passes throughâ€”this is our Sigmoid function, which decides what information is important enough to pass on.
    *   `y_pred = S`.
5.  **Loss Calculation:** Compares predictions (`y_pred`) with true values (`y_true`) using a loss function.
    *   We'll use Mean Squared Error (MSE): `Loss = (y_pred - y_true)^2`.ves the factory is our prediction.
    *   The result is a single loss score.5.  **Customer Feedback (Loss):** We compare our product with what customers actually wanted (`y_true`), measuring how far off we were using MSE: `Loss = (y_pred - y_true)^2`.

That completes the forward pass. The next question is: how do we update the weights and biases?That completes the forward pass. The next question is: how do we update the weights and biases?

### Backward Pass Explained (Weight Updates)### Backward Pass Explained (Weight Updates)

The backward pass adjusts weights to minimize the loss.The backward pass adjusts weights to minimize the loss.

**Understanding the Loss Landscape:**
Imagine plotting the loss based on the difference between predictions and true values (`y_pred - y_true`). Since we square the difference (MSE), this forms a parabola.between predictions and true values (`y_pred - y_true`). Since we square the difference (MSE), this forms a parabola.
Our goal is to reach the minimum point (loss = 0).
*   If our current loss is at point `L1` (predictions too low), we need to *increase* predictions.rease* predictions.
*   If at point `L2` (predictions too high), we need to *decrease* predictions.*   If at point `L2` (predictions too high), we need to *decrease* predictions.

**Gradient Descent:**
How do we know which way to adjust? We use the *gradient* (the slope or derivative) of the loss function at our current point.
*   The gradient tells us the direction of the steepest ascent. To minimize loss, we move in the *opposite* direction of the gradient.teepest ascent. To minimize loss, we move in the *opposite* direction of the gradient.
*   This process is called **Gradient Descent**.
*   A key property of MSE: larger errors result in larger gradients, leading to bigger initial adjustments.*   A key property of MSE: larger errors result in larger gradients, leading to bigger initial adjustments.

*Figure 2: Visualization of gradient descent optimization on a loss landscape, showing how parameters are updated to minimize loss.**Figure 2: Visualization of gradient descent optimization on a loss landscape, showing how parameters are updated to minimize loss.*

**The Learning Rate (`alpha`):**
Simply subtracting the full gradient might cause us to overshoot the minimum, potentially oscillating back and forth (`L1` to `L2` to `L1`...).th (`L1` to `L2` to `L1`...).
To control the step size, we introduce a **learning rate** (`alpha`), a small positive number (e.g., 0.01, 0.001).all positive number (e.g., 0.01, 0.001).
*   **Weight Update Rule:** `new_weights = old_weights - alpha * gradient`
*   By multiplying the gradient by `alpha`, we take smaller, more controlled steps towards the minimum.*   By multiplying the gradient by `alpha`, we take smaller, more controlled steps towards the minimum.

**The Chain Rule:**
Our network has multiple steps (Layer 1 -> Activation -> Loss). How do we calculate the gradient of the *loss* with respect to the *weights* (`dL/dw`), which are used much earlier?-> Activation -> Loss). How do we calculate the gradient of the *loss* with respect to the *weights* (`dL/dw`), which are used much earlier?
We use the **Chain Rule** from calculus.
*   Example: Input `X` -> Function `Y(X)` -> Function `Z(Y)`.
*   To find `dZ/dX`, we multiply the derivatives of each step: `dZ/dX = dZ/dY * dY/dX`.*   To find `dZ/dX`, we multiply the derivatives of each step: `dZ/dX = dZ/dY * dY/dX`.

**Applying the Chain Rule to Our Network:**
To find `dL/dw` (the gradient needed to update weights):
1.  Calculate `dL/dy_pred`: Derivative of the Loss function w.r.t. predictions.ction w.r.t. predictions.
    *   For MSE: `dL/dy_pred = 2 * (y_pred - y_true)`.
2.  Calculate `dy_pred/dl1`: Derivative of the Activation function (Sigmoid) w.r.t. the output of layer 1.d) w.r.t. the output of layer 1.
3.  Calculate `dl1/dw`: Derivative of Layer 1's output w.r.t. the weights. Layer 1's output w.r.t. the weights.
    *   This is simply the input `X`.    *   This is simply the input `X`.

**Final Gradient for Weights:** `dL/dw = (dL/dy_pred) * (dy_pred/dl1) * (dl1/dw)`**Final Gradient for Weights:** `dL/dw = (dL/dy_pred) * (dy_pred/dl1) * (dl1/dw)`

**Gradient for Biases (`dL/db`):**
The process is similar, but the last derivative changes:
*   `dl1/db`: Derivative of Layer 1's output w.r.t. the bias. Layer 1's output w.r.t. the bias.
    *   This is simply `1`.
**Final Gradient for Biases:** `dL/db = (dL/dy_pred) * (dy_pred/dl1) * (dl1/db)`**Final Gradient for Biases:** `dL/db = (dL/dy_pred) * (dy_pred/dl1) * (dl1/db)`

That covers the core mechanics of the backward pass.That covers the core mechanics of the backward pass.

### The Dot Product### The Dot Product

One more technical aspect: the **dot product**.
Why use it? It efficiently calculates the weighted sum in our layers (`X * w`) and helps measure similarity between vectors (like input `X` and weight vector `w`).Why use it? It efficiently calculates the weighted sum in our layers (`X * w`) and helps measure similarity between vectors (like input `X` and weight vector `w`).

Consider an input vector `X` and two weight vectors `w1` and `w2`. Which weight vector is more "aligned" or similar to the input?ned" or similar to the input?
*   Similarity depends on both the *magnitude* (length) of the vectors and the *angle* between them.the vectors and the *angle* between them.
*   The dot product captures this relationship efficiently.*   The dot product captures this relationship efficiently.

**Calculating the Dot Product:**
Given `X = [x1, x2, ...]` and `w1 = [w1_1, w1_2, ...]`:
*   Dot Product (`X . w1`) = `(x1 * w1_1) + (x2 * w1_2) + ...`2 * w1_2) + ...`
*   It's the sum of the element-wise products.
*   Larger dot product values generally indicate greater similarity/alignment between the vectors.*   Larger dot product values generally indicate greater similarity/alignment between the vectors.

## Calculating the Dot Product (Coding)## Calculating the Dot Product (Coding)

Hello and welcome. Let's implement the dot product calculation using Python and NumPy. You can find the code in the `015_NeuralNetworkFromScratch` subfolder.Hello and welcome. Let's implement the dot product calculation using Python and NumPy. You can find the code in the `015_NeuralNetworkFromScratch` subfolder.

We only need NumPy:eed NumPy:
```python
import numpy as nport numpy as np
``````

Let's define sample input and weight vectors:ine sample input and weight vectors:
```python
X = np.array([1, 2, 3])
w1 = np.array([0.2, 0.8, -0.5])
w2 = np.array([-0.5, 0.1, 0.9])= np.array([-0.5, 0.1, 0.9])
``````

**Manual Calculation:**
Calculating the dot product manually for `X` and `w1`:ng the dot product manually for `X` and `w1`:
```python
dot_X_w1_manual = (X[0] * w1[0]) + (X[1] * w1[1]) + (X[2] * w1[2])] * w1[1]) + (X[2] * w1[2])
# -> (1 * 0.2) + (2 * 0.8) + (3 * -0.5) + (3 * -0.5)
# -> 0.2 + 1.6 - 1.5 = 0.3
print(dot_X_w1_manual) # Output: 0.3nt(dot_X_w1_manual) # Output: 0.3
```
This is tedious for larger vectors.This is tedious for larger vectors.

Similarly for `X` and `w2`: for `X` and `w2`:
```python
dot_X_w2_manual = (X[0] * w2[0]) + (X[1] * w2[1]) + (X[2] * w2[2])] * w2[1]) + (X[2] * w2[2])
# -> (1 * -0.5) + (2 * 0.1) + (3 * 0.9) + (3 * 0.9)
# -> -0.5 + 0.2 + 2.7 = 2.4
print(dot_X_w2_manual) # Output: 2.4nt(dot_X_w2_manual) # Output: 2.4
```
Comparing the results (0.3 vs 2.4), `w2` has a larger dot product with `X`, suggesting more similarity in this case.Comparing the results (0.3 vs 2.4), `w2` has a larger dot product with `X`, suggesting more similarity in this case.

dot_X_w2_numpy = np.dot(X, w2)
print(dot_X_w2_numpy) # Output: 2.4nt(dot_X_w2_numpy) # Output: 2.4

**Dot Product**: A mathematical way of asking "How aligned are these two things?" When input and weights are aligned, the dot product is high. It's like measuring how much two people agree on a set of topics.**Activation Function**: The network's decision-maker. The Sigmoid function we use is like a bouncer at a club with a strict 0-1 scale: "How likely are you to get in?"**Gradient Descent**: Not a fancy ski resortâ€”it's simply the idea of taking small steps downhill to find the lowest point of error. Learning rate is just deciding how big those steps should be.**Backpropagation**: Sounds like sci-fi time travel, but it's just calculus telling us "if you want to get to the mountain valley, go downhill." It's how neural networks learn from mistakes by adjusting weights backward through the network.Before we dive deeper, let's demystify some terms that make neural networks sound more complex than they really are:## Buzzword Breakdown: Neural Network Edition---
