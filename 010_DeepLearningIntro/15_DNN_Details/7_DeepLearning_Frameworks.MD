# Deep Learning Frameworks

Deep learning frameworks are software libraries that provide a clear and concise way to define, train, and deploy machine learning models. These frameworks abstract away much of the complexity in building deep learning systems, allowing researchers and developers to focus on model architecture rather than low-level implementation details.

## Key Components of Deep Learning Frameworks

Most deep learning frameworks share the following key components:

1. **Tensor Operations**: Efficient manipulation of multi-dimensional arrays
2. **Automatic Differentiation**: Calculation of gradients required for model training
3. **GPU Acceleration**: Parallel computation capabilities for faster training
4. **High-level APIs**: Simplified model construction and training interfaces
5. **Pre-trained Models**: Libraries of ready-to-use architectures and weights
6. **Deployment Tools**: Methods to move models from training to production
