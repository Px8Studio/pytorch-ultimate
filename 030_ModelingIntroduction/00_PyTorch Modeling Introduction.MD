In this module, we will introduce you to PyTorch modeling. You will learn to build and train models from scratch, including linear regression. The module covers batch processing, datasets, and dataloaders to manage data effectively. You will also explore techniques for saving, loading, and optimizing models, including hyperparameter tuning, to enhance your machine learning workflow.
Learning Objectives
Construct and train machine learning models using PyTorch.
